# OverfitDTI
This repository contains the source code,  details of data processing and datasets used for “Overfit deep neural network for predicting drug–target interactions”.
Much of this code builds on the DeepPurpose framework, and we thank the original authors of DeepPurpose.
The pre-trained models file are too big, and they are provided on your request.
